# Hello Human
<!-- Dynamic language change, as if someone were typing 
{ include hello %}

I'm Sean. I like to arrange bits of text on screens. Sometimes if I hit the right keys something nifty comes out.

This is my personal blog and website development fun place. Here be rants, musings, software speak, how-to's, developer-ese, and more. The idea is that some of this will be useful. There will also be superfluous and anomalous feature implementations. Browse at your own risk.
