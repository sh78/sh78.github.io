        <p>I spilled water on my main computer. It’s currently sitting in a plastic drawer
along with about 2 kilograms of Basmati rice. Let’s change the subject.</p>

<p>Back in 2010, I bought my first Apple computer. Say what you will about the
Apple ecosystem and its retention policies, but this thing is a beast. I’m
typing on it right now. It booted macOS High Sierra from a teeny little Samsung
T5 external SSD that I got recently, and decided to <a href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy
Clone</a> my main system’s macOS image into as part of my
regularly scheduled backups. Pics or it didn’t happen, you say?</p>

<p><img src="" data-src="/assets/images/hesap-about.jpg" alt="The About this Mac window on my 2010 MacBook Pro" /></p>

<p><em>An aside to the meticulous folks at Bombich</em>: Nice touch on making Carbon Copy Cloner aware of its own inception!</p>

<p><img src="" data-src="/assets/images/hesap-ccc-is-nice.png" alt="Carbon Copy Cloner alerting the user that it paused the automated task that created it." /></p>

<p>I like to name my computers. Like <code class="highlighter-rouge">hostname NAME</code> name them. I named this
computer hesap back in 2012, which is Turkish for “calculation” or “bill/check”.
It has lived up to its name more so than I could possibly imagine at the time.
If you look at the calculation of how many computational hours, <abbr title="Also Known As">AKA</abbr> money and enjoyment, it’s bestowed upon me,
then yeah: it’s some good math. Second best purchase I ever made, next to a
plane ticket.</p>

<p>“Ok, internet stranger&gt; what’s so special about this?” you might be thinking.
“You took good care of an expensive laptop and had it sitting around for
a few years and it works. Great!” I can hear you sarcastically projecting. Here
are some highlights from the checkered biography of this “laptop”, as you call
it.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-hesap">A Brief History of Hesap</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2010">2010</time></strong> Purchased in the spring. It had a
faulty M key that Apple fought me on replacing (and lost). Pristine condition
at this point. I kept it in a case and everything.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><time datetime="2012-07-14">July, 2012</time></strong> Hesap is purring right
along as my daily driver (note the aforementioned case).
<img src="" data-src="/assets/images/hesap-guinness-espresso.jpg" alt="Hesap at a cafe, next to a Guinness and an espresso, with CSS open on screen in Sublime Text." /></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2013-01">January, 2013</time></strong> For reasons that are
outside of the scope of this post, hesap was <strong>slammed into a wall at least 4
or 5 times</strong> (while open and running) and literally <strong>ripped in half</strong> with
someone’s <strong>bare hands</strong>. She was then discarded to the floor and left to
bleed out overnight.  For the curious, this incident involved an acutely
depressed person downing an entire bottle of
<a href="https://www.glenmorangie.com/Official-Site">Glenmorangie</a>. That’s all you
get; I’m not here to judge anyone.</li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2013-01">January, 2013</time></strong> The next day, staring at my
laptops, and holding one of them, I depressed the power button what I thought
would be one last time. A chord in the key of C Major rang out.  It was
alive. I plugged it into an external monitor, and it ran without hindrance.</li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2013-02">February, 2013</time></strong> I brought my laptops to
the local PC repair shop to see what they thought.  Approximately $350 and
several weeks later, I had a built-in screen again (albeit without the little
plastic cover that hides the hinge).</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><time datetime="2013-04-17">April, 2013</time></strong> Here’s hesap helping to
write a site survey and advance for a (fictional) week-long visit by a meat
industry executive with some unknown enemies (sideways!). No issues 2 and a
half years in with a shiny new display.<br />
<img src="" data-src="/assets/images/hesap-bodyguard-school.jpg" alt="Hesap on a table with scattered papers and a radio, with markdown on the screen." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><time datetime="2014">2014</time></strong> Throughout most of 2014, I was the
director of computation for a startup that did video production in Kathmandu,
Nepal. We had a Mac Mini as our office server, running VPN, AFP, Bit Torrent
Sync and Dropbox, and network login facilities for a team of 5 editors. 100’s
of Gigabytes per week had to be transferred between hemispheres. In a country
with immense load shedding and slow internet, we had to have backups for the
backups. Hesap acted as a fill-in server when the Mac Mini had a problem or
when the power was out for so long that the APC died. Even when it wasn’t
serving, I was working about 27 hours per day at that time, so it <strong>basically
was not powered down for a little over a year</strong>.<br />
<img src="" data-src="/assets/images/hesap-goes-to-kathmandu.jpg" alt="Hesap (left) at the office next to it's minions (other MacBooks)." /></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2014">Summer, 2014</time></strong> - First water damage I remember
it like it was yesterday. I was at a cafe near Kupondole in Lalitpur taking a
break from the office to write an enormous bash script to automate
initialization of WordPress instances on a CentOS <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr>. In my caffeination, I knocked over a one litre
bottle of water, sending its contents <strong>straight into the trackpad</strong>. The
cursor started rapidly jumping in every direction, and I did a hard shutdown
by holding the button down and took a few hours off. It came right back to
life later that day. Maybe I should have named it Eliot Ness.</li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2015-02">February, 2015</time></strong> Return from a brief hiatus
Late in 2014 I acquired a MacBook Air, named hava, and gave old hesap a much
needed vacation. But that vacation would be short-lived. My housemate spilled
a delicious curry all over hava and fried the logic board. To add to the
hilarity, hesap had recently developed a new problem. The left side of the
track pad had popped out during a rough taxi ride through a contraction zone.
The physical click mechanism didn’t work, so without a mouse I had to line up
the pointer with the System Preference to enable tap to click, and stand on
the trackpad on my right big toe to get a click. After that it wasn’t much of
an issue.</li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2015-03">March, 2015</time></strong> For reasons again outside of
the scope of this post, I got stuck in Turkey for months longer than
expected, and all of my worldly possessions were reduced to those which I
brought in my suitcase.  I ended up having to trade my entire (moldy) MacBook
Air to an Apple Abi for a new battery for hesap, whose battery had exploded.
Then, to force the new battery in past the frame damage caused by Glen in
2013, I quite litrally <strong>took a hammer to it</strong> on the floor in my friend’s
living room. It worked. It was at this point that punishing hesap became
something of a hobby.</li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2015">Spring(ish), 2015</time></strong> I was on the Blue &amp;
Gold Ferry heading into Marin to visit a client, and had to do a bit of work
on the way. It was a beautiful day, so I sat at the stern and fired up hesap.
Incidentally, the back of the boat is where gallons of water are spewed unto
once the vessel has reached cruising speed. A minute later Hesap was coated
in a fine yet pervasive mist of splashback; she didn’t so much as flinch.
It’s almost as if the water damage back in Lalitpur had been a catalyst for
an immunity to liquid.</li>
  <li><strong><time datetime="2015-06">June, 2015</time></strong> Hesap was starting to act
funny from time to time; mainly it was rebooting suddenly when under heavier
loads, such as running a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>. In
hindsight I think this was software induced, but I had just started a new
role that required serious uptime on my part, so it was time to buy a fancy
new box that was unlikely to break&gt; a 2015 with Retina<span class="jk">h</span> Display. Hesap was relegated to a partial retirement,
occasionally handling some grunt work like large file transfers or acting as
a home VPN/file server. As the cloud grew, it became less and less relevant
to keep a second computer running.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned, there are numerous other incidents I am
omitting - drops, spills, working outside in the rain, and such. Twelve list
items is enough.</p>

<h2 id="present-day">Present Day</h2>

<p>After almost exactly three years of retirement… It Works! I mean, I certainly
hope my 2015 wakes up with a sane mind later tonight, but yeah; there are some
things I actually miss about this old thing.</p>

<h3 id="things-i-cant-say-about-my-new-model">Things I Can’t Say About My New Model</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The keys actually have travel!</strong> Not only am I typing slightly faster, but
it’s also way more satisfying, almost at a mechanical keyboard level.</li>
  <li><strong>It has tons of cheap and fast storage</strong>. Circa early 2015, I ripped out the
optical drive and replaced it with a 1 terabyte hybrid <abbr title="Hard Disk Drive">HDD</abbr>/<abbr title="Solid State Drive">SSD</abbr>. The main drive was
also upgraded to a smaller <abbr title="Solid State Drive">SSD</abbr> for the
<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> and main applications. The new model ha
128 gigabytes because at the time even 256 gigabytes was disgustingly expensive.
The new model can’t be upgraded like this because it doesn’t have an optical
drive to begin with, and the SSD it came with is soldered on to the motherboard.</li>
  <li>It has a CD drive. This one isn’t bold because while technically true, I don’t
care. Good riddance.</li>
  <li><strong>It has 16 gigabytes of <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr></strong>. I
bought a nifty kit from <a href="https://www.macsales.com/">OWC</a> that the MacBook
actually recognized and utilized, despite Apple’s claim that 8 is the max. This
kit isn’t available for my new model, again due to the soldering and such.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flaws-but-not-dealbreakers">Flaws But Not Dealbreakers</h3>

<p>That being said:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve really become accustomed to the <abbr title="High Dots Per Inch">HiDPI</abbr> displays of late. It’s weird to
actually see pixels.</li>
  <li>It gets really hot. My wrists are sweating after a couple hours.</li>
  <li>USB 3 makes everything else feel tortoise-esque.</li>
  <li>It’s not much of a <em>lap</em>top now, because if you’re wearing shorts it will
electrocute you. But no biggie, I placed a warning label on the bonnet:
<img src="" data-src="/assets/images/hesap-yuksek-gerilim.jpg" alt="hesap with a sticker saying yüksek gerilim, Turkish for high voltage." /></li>
</ul>

<h2>🍻</h2>

<p>It looks like hesap will continue its copious chronology of computation for
countless years to come. Here’s to you, old chum. Pay no mind to the naysayers
who proclaim you to be a superfluous, fancy, expensive thing; they look not far
into the future.</p>
