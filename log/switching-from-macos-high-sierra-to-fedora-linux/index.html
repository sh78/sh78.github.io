        <p>This is a tale of two operating systems. A tale of liberation and discov- OK, sorry. Got carried away. Reset.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm writing this mainly as a high-level migration guide for those jumping into Linux - specifically, from macOS to Fedora. It also contains some strategies and principals for maintaining cross-platform configurations. It will not cover much of the nitty-gritty configuration details, as those are in my <a href="https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/">dotfiles repo</a> which just might get a nice README some day.</p>

<p>Note that everything here was done on a Early 2015 Retina MacBook Pro running Fedora 28 latest as of <time>2018-05-24</time>. Also note that this is a likely a <strong>multi-day</strong> project, unless you have an unsafe amount of caffeine.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>

<p>Free and open source is good; yes, I know, Fedora isn‚Äôt technically 100% ‚Äúfree‚Äù <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.en.html#Fedora">according to Richard Stallman/FSF</a>.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt want to be chained to Apple‚Äôs design decisions. Or Fedora‚Äôs. If I can make this work, then distro hopping is all the more feasible.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt need much of what‚Äôs available on macOS now that I‚Äôm shell- and browser- oriented. I spend so much time clearing the clutter.</p>

<p>Better control of my environment form and function.</p>

<p>Wanted to use i3 for a long time now.</p>

<p>Can run on almost any Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Forces me to learn more about *nix based systems, which is fun and rewarding.</p>

<h1 id="whoami">whoami</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve been playing with computers for about 20 years now. About 12 of those were in a professional capacity. I currently work as a front-end developer for a large house-hold name, but have bounced around between marketing, bizdev, back-end, devops, systems administration, and general IT consulting. I switched to OS X in 2008 for my first full-time computer gig at the ripe age of 18, and have been pushing for more efficient and effective workflows ever since discovering that pressing Command+Shift+/ opened a help menu where you could type a query to semi-fuzzily find a command to run. I thought it was hella sweet to just type ‚Äútra sel‚Äù instead of digging through the Photoshop menus for ‚ÄúTransform Selection.‚Äù Ah, to be young.</p>

<p>Lately, I use less; well, less on the GUI side and (way) more on the shell side and in the browser. Gone are the days of a $7 Mac app for each task; gone further are the days of mucking about in Microsoft products like Word, or troubleshooting IMAP settings in Mail.app. Since finally making the switch to vim earlier this year, I‚Äôm diligent to limit my core tools to a terminal and a browser. Anything else is just a rarity; a novelty, or an artifact of interfacing with someone else who uses such a tool.</p>

<p>So, without further adieu, here is the play-by-play migration of approximately 10 years‚Äô worth of workflow, built upon the Apple ecosystem, to a modern Linux environment - in chronological order.</p>

<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

<h2 id="the-host-machine">The Host Machine</h2>

<p>Everything you see here (and more :wink) was done using an early 2015 Retina MacBook Pro 13‚Äù. I‚Äôm quite happy with how well Fedora worked out of the box. Immediately on boot the hidpi display looked stellar, the WiFi worked (suck it Arch users), and the ducking <strong>volume/brightness keys worked</strong>. It really is 2018. ü¶Ü</p>

<h2 id="portability-speed-and-redundancy-with-a-bootable-external-drive">Portability, Speed, and Redundancy With A Bootable External Drive</h2>

<p>One thing I‚Äôve always wanted to do is have my entire environment on a microSD
card. This isn‚Äôt very practical to use as a daily driver, but I did find the
next best thing: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073H552FK/">A tiny portable USB 3 SSD that is really
fast</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still locked in to using macOS for work, I made two partitions on this
drive. One is a bootable macOS that I <a href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy
Clone</a>d, and the other where I installed Fedora
originally. I run my mac from the external drive and clone it to the internal as backup, so I‚Äôm always ready to travel light. I used to take my personal laptop to work, in case I needed to work on something personal before or after work. Now I just bring the drive and plug it in to a work machine or a public computer if I really need to get something done that‚Äôs not easy on a phone or someone else‚Äôs browser.</p>

<p>Oh, and the portable SSD over USB3 or thunderbolt is <strong>fast</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>Using <a href="">Fedora Media Writer</a> was child‚Äôs play. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;rant&gt;</code>Back in my day, we had to use a virtual Windows machine and Unetbootin, wait like an hour, walk 12 miles in the snow, and <em>maybe</em> it would boot.<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;/rant&gt;</code></p>

<p>After holding down alt during startup to get the boot menu, two different Fedora boot loaders appeared. For whatever reason, it they both worked.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve installed Ubuntu several times in my life, so I assumed that the live USB would set up the persistent install on itself like Ubuntu‚Äôs offers to do. Well, it doesn‚Äôt. I was greeted with ‚Äúdisk is busy‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt write‚Äù blah blah blah on each attempt from the set up wizard. Luckily, I had a spare SD card around, so I set up the Fedora Media Writer on that and started over.</p>

<p>Not much else to fret over here. I picked a time zone, configured the partition scheme with 100GB for the macOS image and the rest for Fedora, and clicked ‚ÄúSail off into the sunset.‚Äù</p>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdxtLScVAAET6Lc.jpg" alt="The Fedora hot dog, inspiring confidence from the start." /></p>

<h1 id="first-run">First Run</h1>

<p>The desktop environment that ships with Fedora is pretty cool. It‚Äôs sleek, has nice animations, some familiar shortcuts, desktop notifications, Google/Facebook integration, and even a feature like Spotlight. Overall very responsive and polished. It comes with some office apps, a disk utility, mail, calendar, etc. Cute. It even notified me to take my medicine because I signed in with Google and it read my calendar. Neat.</p>

<p>So, obviously, I‚Äôm not using these.</p>

<p>For now, the built in terminal and a good browser will suffice.</p>

<h2 id="uninstalls">Uninstalls</h2>

<p>I personally like to get rid of some of the default applications included, since I won‚Äôt use them and they significantly slow down upgrades.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">yes</span> | <span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf remove gnome-calendar cheese gnome-contacts gnome-documents evolution photos rhythmbox gnome-maps gnome-weather
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="package-manager-and-development-tools">Package Manager and Development Tools</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">dnf</code> is the package manager for Fedora. Let‚Äôs update our packages software and install some core build tools.</p>

<p>After reading up on <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF_system_upgrade">Fedora System Upgrades</a> let‚Äôs start with the latest and greatest:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># WARNING - Reboot Imminent</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> update <span class="nt">--refresh</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> <span class="nb">install </span>dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> system-upgrade download <span class="nt">--refresh</span> <span class="nt">--releasever</span><span class="o">=</span>28
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf system-upgrade reboot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>&lt;img src=‚Äù‚Äù data-src=‚Äùhttps://media.giphy.com/media/10lBhcF4eTJZWU/giphy.gif‚Äù alt=‚ÄùAn IT person with title ‚Äúhave you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?‚Äù‚Äù&gt;</p>

<p>Ah, you‚Äôre back. Now let‚Äôs do the equivalent of <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcode-select --install</code> on macOS:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nb">install </span>util-linux-user
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> groupinstall <span class="s2">"Development Tools"</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> groupinstall <span class="s2">"C Development Tools and Libraries"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chromeium">Chrom(e)(ium)</h2>

<p>Spent a lot of time trying to set up Chrome from unofficial repositories, just to realize that we have the open-source Chromium instead. So it‚Äôs just:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nb">install </span>chromium
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Signing in to Chrome was a joy; I felt accomplished. All those extensions, bookmarks, and my cool Solarized theme rapidly snapped into existence; I felt immediately at ease.</p>

<h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs a list of my favorite/core Chrome plugins:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim/">cvim</a> - <a href="http://vimperator.org/vimperator.html">vimperator</a> for Chrome. I‚Äôve tried a lot of vim-like chrome extensions, and this is by far the winner.</li>
  <li><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> - (paid) password manager with a great team of humans behind it. More on this later.</li>
  <li><a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> - read it later doohickey.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mercury.postlight.com/reader/">Mercury Reader</a> - read it now doohickey. I feel like this should be built into Chrome by now, but I digress.</li>
  <li><a href="https://type-fu.com/">TypeFu</a> - and extremely excellent typing trainer that adjust to your skill level, tracks your progress with graphs, and even lets you practice against code and upload your own templates. It‚Äôs a one-time $5 purchase and works anywhere that Chrome does.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">Pushbullet</a> - monitor/act on phone notifications, sync SMS, and unified copy/paste. Suck it Apple.</li>
  <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dont-fuck-with-paste/nkgllhigpcljnhoakjkgaieabnkmgdkb?hl=en">Don‚Äôt Fuck With Paste</a> - just what it says. Thwarts nefarious developers that assume you are not responsible enough to paste in your password/account number/what have you.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">Dev Tools</a> - this is of course included by default, but just a hat tip for how excellent Chrome Dev Tools is.</li>
</ul>

<p>And while we‚Äôre at it, web apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google‚Äôs things - Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Keep are my core utils. <a href="https://keep.google.com">Keep</a> is not very well promoted but it‚Äôs a fantastic unified note space with support for #tagging and images. Also Hangouts is great for making calls, but I‚Äôm not sure if this works for everyone or just <a href="https://fi.google.com/">Project Fi</a> subscribers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://explainshell.com/">ExplainShell</a> - breaks down shell commands into their components and explains them. Pure god status. I love it so much I <a href="https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/blob/aabba49702344b4cc2468763b5cd16df75c65529/.config/omf/aliases.load#L216">aliased it</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://regexr.com/">RegExr</a> - the Samuel L Jackson of browser-based Regex prototyping.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/">Pixlr</a> - for photo manipulation. I don‚Äôt have very advanced photo needs any more, and web optimization happens <a href="https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/blob/aabba49702344b4cc2468763b5cd16df75c65529/.config/omf/aliases.load#L280">in the terminal</a>. I‚Äôll probably get into GIMP at some point, but Pixlr was actually a nicer experience for my simple use cases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Adobe Kuler</a> - amazing interface for exploring color palettes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a> - tool for editing/optimizing SVG.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cvim">cvim</h3>

<p>Having <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh?hl=en">cvim</a> installed was great, because many of the native shortcuts in Chromium are a lot different than macOS Chrome. The super key basically does nothing. Being able to immediately navigate with the familiar vim bindings proved very useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim/issues/312#issuecomment-156189327">Getting the local .cvimrc loaded was a bit on tricky on macOS</a>, I recall. Also be sure to ‚Äúallow access to file URLs‚Äù from the chrome://extensions/settings:</p>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jnH8YmH.png" alt="cvim settings" /></p>

<h3 id="alternative">Alternative</h3>

<p><strong>Someday</strong> I‚Äôll probably switch to <a href="https://www.qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a> full-time, but for now I‚Äôm quite dialed in to the Chrome economy.</p>

<h2 id="1password">1Password</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm an avid 1Password user. It‚Äôs great not to type passwords, and not to worry if one service gets hacked.</p>

<p>Close call here - I totally forgot that 1Password wasn‚Äôt on Linux. I was about to call it all off, as 1Password has become an invaluable tool in my arsenal. Well, actually, I was going to suck it up and just use the web interface, which is nice but not native. Before saddling up, I did a quick web search and OH HALLO - <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/11/13/1password-x-a-look-at-the-future-of-1password-in-the-browser/">1Password X</a> üéâ</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also a <a href="https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/CLI">1Password CLI</a> that I‚Äôd like to test drive, but not today. Nor tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Someday</strong> I‚Äôll probably end up using <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/#other">‚Äòpass‚Äò</a> or vim‚Äôs ‚Äò:encrypt‚Äò (if there‚Äôs a way to make it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/575817/vim-encryption-how-to-break-it">more secure</a>), but then again 1Password really comes in handy when it comes to interfacing with others.</p>

<p>Thinking back to the time that I ended up being in a coma for one month, I wish we had been on the 1Password family plan with my bank information and logins were stored in a shared vault accessible to my parents and my wife. I still remember how difficult it was to explain what my computer‚Äôs password was, and worse yet the unlock pattern for my phone, while unable to speak due to being intubated and too paralyzed to write.</p>

<h2 id="interfacing-with-the-system-clipboard">Interfacing With The System Clipboard</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">xclip</code> is essentially the linux <code class="highlighter-rouge">pbcopy</code>. You can pipe to it and the input will
write to the system clipboard, ready to ctrl-c.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> <span class="nb">install </span>xclip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will come in handy for yanking content out of vim and tmux (see tmux section later on), and to avoid using the mouse in general scenarios. Now, before you get to piping, note the <a href="">extra flags required</a> to actually get the main system (GUI) clipboard. To copy something that you want to Control+v:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat </span>file.txt | xclip <span class="nt">-selection</span> clipboard
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make things simpler, I set up a fish function to decide which clipboard to
use based on environment variables that I set higher up in the stack:</p>

<pre><code class="language-fish">function clip --description "Substitute (eval) the right clipboard for this OS"
  eval $CLIPBOARD
end
</code></pre>

<p>So <code class="highlighter-rouge">$CLIPBOARD</code> works because in my environment file (loaded first in <a href="">init.fish</a>) there‚Äôs:</p>

<pre><code class="language-fish"># operating system
set -gx OSTYPE (uname)

# os-specific env vars
switch $OSTYPE
  case "Linux"
    set -gx CLIPBOARD xclip -selection clipboard
  case "Darwin"
    set -gx CLIPBOARD pbcopy
end
</code></pre>

<p>We could also just test for existence of the commands, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">test (which pbcopy)...</code>, but I like this method because it reads well and I plan on setting more environment vars later on.</p>

<p>P.S. I‚Äôm too lazy to port this to bash at the moment. <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo $this &gt; someday_maybe</code>.</p>

<h2 id="file-synchronization">File Synchronization</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve been happily using Google Drive to sync my configs and working files for quite some time now. I prefer it to something like Dropbox because 1) less accounts, 2) everyone has Google, and 3) it‚Äôs unparalleled when it comes to actually manipulating and sharing your bits.</p>

<p>Well, there‚Äôs no official Google Drive client for Linux. I read some <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/196635/an-official-google-drive-for-linux-is-here-sort-of-maybe-this-is-all-well-ever-get/">click</a> <a href="https://beebom.com/unofficial-google-drive-linux-clients/">baits</a> and tried some of the most viable seeming options. Order up, on the house.</p>

<h3 id="gnome">GNOME</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-google-drive-on-gnome/">GNOME Drive integration</a> that ships with Fedora doesn‚Äôt actually sync. I tried clicking the mount just to see, and 10 minutes later I still couldn‚Äôt even get a file listing. Yuck.</p>

<p>Even if it works as expected, it still wouldn‚Äôt cut it for me. I need something that can actively watch of file and sync it, making it available instantly when I switch computers or switch to mobile.</p>

<h3 id="rclone"><code class="highlighter-rouge">rclone</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://rclone.org/install/">rclone</a> seemed perfect at first, but the <a href="https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues">588 open issues</a> were a terrifying read. Also the docs warn against extensive use with Google Drive, which is even more discouraging.</p>

<p>I ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">rclone config</code> and did a sync of just my dotfiles as a test:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rclone <span class="nb">sync </span>google-drive:/dotfiles Drive/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After about 5 minutes I started getting 500 responses from the server:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2018/05/22 22:14:03 ERROR : .local/share/omf/lib/git/git_is_stashed.fish: Failed to copy: failed to open <span class="nb">source </span>object: bad response: 500: 500 Internal Server Error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So about 7 minutes total for 108MB. Not bad, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">500</code>‚Äôs are bad. Now I‚Äôm imagining running opposing one-way <code class="highlighter-rouge">sync</code>s via <code class="highlighter-rouge">cron</code> and destroying my file system silently in the background.</p>

<p>Just for kicks, I changed into my dotfiles dir, which also happens to be a git repo, and ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code>. As anticipated:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fatal: bad object HEAD
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The repo arrived corrupt, yet <code class="highlighter-rouge">rclone</code> only warned me about the 500 for the file in ‚Äò.local/share/omf/‚Äô. Bad new bears, Batman.</p>

<p>Moving on‚Ä¶.</p>

<h3 id="insync">InSync</h3>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/e9i8NXW1GSqAg/giphy.gif" alt="The boy band sensation NSync" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.insynchq.com/">InSync</a> looks promising, but at $30 does not conform to the Tao of Linux. ü§Æ</p>

<h3 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h3>

<p>Is it time to switch back to Dropbox? They have excellent <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux">Linux support</a>. I‚Äôd definitely miss the native Android integration and editing tools of Drive, but I‚Äôm running out of options here. Or am I?</p>

<h3 id="cloudcross">CloudCross</h3>

<p>This is a manual push/pull app. I didn‚Äôt try it since I want file watching and syncing.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MasterSoft24/cloudcross">CloudCross</a></p>

<h3 id="grive--grive2">Grive / Grive2</h3>

<p>Again, no auto syncing, despite looking like a good program.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fossmint.com/grive2-google-drive-client-for-linux/">Grive2</a> / <a href="https://www.fossmint.com/grive-a-dockerized-google-drive-client-for-linux/">Grive docker</a></p>

<h3 id="the-results-are-in-i-caved">The Results Are In: I Caved</h3>

<p>I prepared to cough up the $30 for InSync and started the 14 day trial. The main factors that convinced me or seemingly positive feedback in the community about them, a good collection of support forms and blog posts by the developers, and strong support for running headless which is quite useful. <a href="https://www.thefanclub.co.za/overgrive">OverGrive</a> does similar but only mentioned support for a handful of desktop environments, not including i3, which is where I want to end up. Also they mentioned something about not supporting sym links, which would make my dotfile synchronization quite difficult. Furthermore, I didn‚Äôt find any very useful reviews, so I partially bought it just to bear the burden for anyone else in my predicament.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no dnf package for InSync, so:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nb">install </span>sni-qt
xdg-open <span class="o">[</span>https://www.insynchq.com/downloads]<span class="o">(</span>https://www.insynchq.com/downloads<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="c"># download and follow the wizard</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I had some issues with <a href="https://help.insynchq.com/installation-on-windows-linux-and-macos/getting-started-with-insync/set-up-guide">InSync‚Äôs initial set up</a> process, but got it sorted out quickly.</p>

<p>On first run, it looks like it‚Äôs not working, but it actually is. First it opens a browser for Google authorization. Then there‚Äôs supposed to be a window that pops up asking your sync preferences, but it was opened behind other windows, and did not appear as a current application in the Command+Tab view or the GNOME Mission-Control-Type-Thing. I had to restart it with all other windows closed to see it. Also, don‚Äôt accidentally click anywhere else outside of the pop up window or you‚Äôll have to restart again. <strong>ALSO</strong>, it was tiny because they didn‚Äôt develop it to account for HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>After confirming your sync folder, it disappears and again looks like nothing is happening. Also there‚Äôs no system tray (top bar) icon as depicted on their landing page. Since I thought it wasn‚Äôt working, I decided to try <a href="https://medium.com/@insync/run-google-drive-via-command-line-c3c504425fac">the headless cli</a>.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>insync start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No output returned. Then I tried:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>insync get_sync_progress
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Et voil√†! It returned ‚Äú9053 files queued‚Äù. We may just use truncated output of  <code class="highlighter-rouge">insync get_sync_progress</code> in a future i3 <a href="https://i3wm.org/i3status/manpage.html">status bar</a>‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt touch that dial.</p>

<p>So, at this point there‚Äôs still nothing in my ~/Drive dir that I choose‚Ä¶. In the docs, they show additional steps where you pick which folders to sync and can choose some settings. I didn‚Äôt see that; when I chose the sync location, the InSync window just disappeared.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that just running <code class="highlighter-rouge">insync show</code> brings the window back. From there I was able to check the boxes for folders to sync and actually start the process.</p>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/f9XGm2x.png" alt="the InSync application's main window" /></p>

<p>While these issues are really annoying for a $30 Linux app, the bottom line is it works for my needs and blows away the competition.</p>

<h1 id="software--configuration">Software &amp; Configuration</h1>

<p>Once files are synced, we‚Äôre ready to make this house a <code class="highlighter-rouge">~</code>.</p>

<p>This section will cover both installation and configuration troubleshooting. The
end result will be portable configs that work in Linux and Mac via fish, bash,
and zsh (and likely sh, too).</p>

<h2 id="cue-the-dotfiles">Cue the dotfiles!</h2>

<p>This is what it‚Äôs all about. Years upon years of finely crafted configs, just waiting to be unleashed into a new host and propagate my opinions‚Ä¶. Now that files are synced, I need a tool like <a href="https://github.com/ira/mackup/">Mackup</a> to handle all the symlinking for me. Oh wait - <em>mac</em>kup is for Linux too. So far, so winning.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--upgrade</span> <span class="nt">--user</span> mackup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming Mackup is already <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#configuration">well-configured</a>, we can now load up all the dotfiles symlinks:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> ~/Drive/dotfiles/.mackup<span class="k">*</span> ~
<span class="nb">yes</span> | mackup restore
<span class="c"># mackup confirms a lot, so yes just auto-answers mackup's questions</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/vx9VLYd.png" alt="\`~\` sweet \`~\`" /></p>

<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a>, but also like to keep vim 8 around just in case. In case of what you ask? I have no idea.</p>

<p>This package comes with python3 support and the other goodies:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nb">install </span>vim-enhanced
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now for Neo:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> <span class="nb">install </span>neovim
dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> <span class="nb">install </span>python2-neovim python3-neovim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There was surprisingly little to debug here. On launch my auto-magical Vundle script installed all my plugins, and there were no warnings/incompatibilities with other stuff in my <a href="https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/blob/aabba49702344b4cc2468763b5cd16df75c65529/.vimrc#L1">vimrc</a>. The main issue was a whacked out color scheme (from using Solarized palette in iTerm) and weird characters in the <a href="">airline</a> status line.</p>

<p><img src="" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cAYDEuA.png" alt="My accidental rave style color scheme in vim" /></p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs pick a new terminal, and figure out about installing fonts to tidy up that status line.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-terminal-emulator">Choosing A Terminal Emulator</h2>

<p>There are quite literally a metric shit-ton of terminal emulators for Linux out there. Coming from <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm</a>, there‚Äôs some pretty big shoes to fill here. I was about to go with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=eaBf_yFHps8">urxvt</a>, but then remembered that I hadn‚Äôt checked on <a href="https://hyper.is/">Hyper</a> in awhile.</p>

<p>Hyper is continuing to grow, and has some <a href="https://github.com/bnb/awesome-hyper">awesome extensions</a> going for it that cover much of what I use in iTerm. The big winner here is that Hyper‚Äôs configuration is plain ol‚Äô JavaScript object, which is perfect for cross-platform syncing.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># requires node/npm</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nb">install </span>nodejs

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="bonus-just-for-kicks">Bonus: Just For Kicks</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">Cool Retro Terminal</a> is pretty, well, cool. I keep it around. Great for when clients come to the office and we need to look professional.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> <span class="nb">install </span>qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtdeclarative qt5-qtdeclarative-devel qt5-qtgraphicaleffects qt5-qtquickcontrols redhat-rpm-config

<h2 id="setting-custom-fonts">Setting Custom Fonts</h2>

<p>I have several fonts I like to bounce between. On a Mac, you drag and drop them into FontBook.app. On Linux, you <code class="highlighter-rouge">cp</code> them to <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/fonts/</code>, which is way cooler. I have one font that is not publicly available, so:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> ~/.local/share/fonts/
<span class="nb">mv </span>DankMono-Regular.ttf DankMono-Italic ~/.local/share/fonts/
<span class="nb">sudo </span>fc-cache <span class="nt">-fv</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the rest, I opted for the <a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-3-install-script">Nerd Fonts install script</a>. Nerd Fonts are also Powerline-patched, but have other cool symbols that I haven‚Äôt used (yet).</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts <span class="c"># 7.6GB!</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span>nerd-fonts
./install.sh AnonymousPro
./install.sh FiraCode
./install.sh Hack
./install.sh SourceCodePro
<span class="nb">cd</span> ..
<span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> nerd-fonts
<span class="c"># log out or reboot to take effect</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For whatever reason, the default GNOME Terminal didn‚Äôt pick up the new fonts, but other applications did. I tried restarting, copying the fonts to /usr/share/fonts/, and a clean install of it - nada. This isn‚Äôt a problem, though, since we have a fancy new terminal as per the above section. <strong>WIN. ING.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tmux">tmux</h2>

<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-tmux-8d784c404340">tmux</a> is another big one. I use it along with <a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator#tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a>, which is a session management system that kicks serious ass and is configured with YAML. The great thing about tmux is that once you get the hang of it, you‚Äôre at home and highly productive wherever tmux is - Mac, Linux, remote server, and what have you. tmux is also great for pair programming over SSH.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dnf <span class="nt">-y</span> <span class="nb">install </span>tmux tmuxinator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point I‚Äôm <strong>still</strong> waiting for my Google Drive sync to complete; it seems a purge is in order‚Ä¶. Just for a sneak preview, I copied my <a href="https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/blob/aabba49702344b4cc2468763b5cd16df75c65529/.tmux.conf#L1"><code class="highlighter-rouge">.tmux.conf</code></a> in and gave it a whirl.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span>sean@localhost ~]<span class="nv">$ </span>tmux
<span class="o">[</span>exited]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It won‚Äôt start! tmux flashes on screen and vanishes. <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/128190/tmux-exits-immediately-after-starting#answer-219000">StackExchange to the rescue</a>! A line I had that helps with <a href="https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard">clipboard integration on macOS</a> was making tmux implode from sheer confusion.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nt">-g</span> default-command <span class="s2">"reattach-to-user-namespace -l </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">SHELL</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So how to keep this working on macOS but not on Linux? <code class="highlighter-rouge">if-shell</code> works nicely here. We can split out OS-specific commands into separate files and <code class="highlighter-rouge">source</code> then:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="nt">-shell</span> <span class="s1">'test "$(uname)" = "Darwin"'</span> <span class="s1">'source ~/.tmux.macos.conf'</span>
<span class="k">if</span><span class="nt">-shell</span> <span class="s1">'test "$(uname)" = "Linux"'</span> <span class="s1">'source ~/.tmux.linux.conf'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was confusing to me for a bit because I wrote the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if-shell</code> directives in
fish, but it turns out tmux holds it down with bash.</p>

<p>Now we set up our files like in <a href="https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/commit/70ab1f332ffdefe6283740deea88e35dd98c6e5f">this commit</a>,</p>

<h2 id="git">git</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">osx-keychain</code> method of saving credentials certainly won‚Äôt work here in
Linusville, so let‚Äôs use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cache</code> method and hold on the data for 18 hours:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> credential.helper <span class="s1">'cache --timeout 28800'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now git will interactively prompt for login as needed.</p>

<h2 id="ranger">Ranger</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve recently discovered ranger, and I‚Äôm hooked. Sometimes, I just need to visually comb through a file system to keep track of what I‚Äôm doing. Ranger is basically the column view (Command+3) in Finder, but in your terminal and souped-up with powerful features. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, though - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzD2UdQl5Gc">watch this</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlolvAVqn10">this</a>.</p>

<p>I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">dnf</code>to install ranger, and ran into a funky issue. Trying to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">zh</code> to show hidden files threw an exception:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The option named <span class="sb">`</span>show_hidden!<span class="s1">' does not exist
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I couldn‚Äôt find this exact error in a web search but noticed that my ranger version was several releases behind what‚Äôs listed on the <a href="https://ranger.github.io/download.html">official site</a>. This wouldn‚Äôt really be a Linux guide without building from source.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget https://ranger.github.io/ranger-stable.tar.gz
<span class="nb">tar </span>xvf ranger-stable.tar.gz
<span class="nb">cd </span>ranger-1<span class="k">*</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>make <span class="nb">install
</span>ranger <span class="nt">--ver</span>
<span class="c"># =&gt; ranger version: ranger-master 1.9.1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With ranger master, <code class="highlighter-rouge">zh</code> works as expected, divulging the whereabouts of hidden files. Hooray for hypothesis!</p>

<h2 id="rbenv">rbenv</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a> is a great tool for ruby version management and containment. There‚Äôs no <code class="highlighter-rouge">dnf</code> package, so we‚Äôll have to do some manual set up.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.rbenv <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> src/configure <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> make <span class="nt">-C</span> src
<span class="c"># I already have a .bash_profile configured for rbenv, so not needed</span>
<span class="c"># echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</span>
~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="vagrantvirtual-box">Vagrant/Virtual Box</h2>

<p>Vagrant has been an invaluable tool in my big fat software development toolbox. I first used it professionally back in 2015 and it totally saved the day. We rebuilt a snowflake (mutable) VPS set up for a complex multi-rails-and-ember app that was already in a high-demand production scenario but had tons of bugs and needed tons of development. Just to paint a picture: the production server didn‚Äôt even have init.d config to start nginx and unicorn, so when it ran out of memory and crashed (on my first day) I had to ssh in manually start everything in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">screen</code> session.</p>

<p>With vagrant, I reverse engineered a similar-enough environment, added some SSL for good measure, pushed to a new server, and ran the migration. After the switch, we were able to confidently push code knowing with reasonable certainty what would result on prod.</p>

<p>When I heard on the internet that Fedora and vagrant have had a checkered past, I was concerned. Luckily some kind and brave soul at ifnottruethenfalse published a great <a href="https://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/install-virtualbox-with-yum-on-fedora-centos-red-hat-rhel/">step by step</a>. Here‚Äôs a summary.</p>

<p>Start by downloading the package and checking your kernel:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo</span> <span class="nt">-i</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> /etc/yum.repos.d/
wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/fedora/virtualbox.repo
dnf update
rpm <span class="nt">-qa</span> kernel |sort <span class="nt">-V</span> |tail <span class="nt">-n</span> 1
<span class="nb">uname</span> <span class="nt">-r</span>
<span class="c"># if the kernel updates, then reboot</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now make sue deps are installed and set up VBox:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dnf <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-y</span> binutils gcc make patch libgomp glibc-headers glibc-devel kernel-headers kernel-devel dkms
dnf <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-y</span> VirtualBox-5.2
/usr/lib/virtualbox/vboxdrv.sh setup
usermod <span class="nt">-a</span> <span class="nt">-G</span> vboxusers user_name
VirtualBox
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I like setting unique host names for my machines. I pick a quality about the machine, then translate that word to Turkish.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>hostnamectl set-hostname sapka
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>‚Äú≈ûapka‚Äù is Turkish for ‚Äúhat‚Äù (Red Hat). My first retina MacBook Pro was named ‚Äúg√∂z‚Äù for ‚Äúeye‚Äù. My MacBook ‚ÄúAir‚Äù was named ‚Äúhava‚Äù (rough translation). Etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<h2 id="automation-is-king">Automation Is King</h2>

<p>On macOS, there is <code class="highlighter-rouge">defaults write</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">defaults export</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">import</code>. So this is Linux, can we automate Fedora‚Äôs preferences in such a fashion?
Well, not going to bother, because here comes <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ in another post. Stay tuned!</p>
