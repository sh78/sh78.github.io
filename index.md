# Hello Human
<!-- Dynamic language change, as if someone were typing 
{ include hello %}
-->

I'm Sean. I like to arrange bits of text on screens. Sometimes if I hit the right keys something nifty comes out. Sometimes people call me a front end developer.

This is my personal website, blog, and web development fun place. Rants, musings, software speak, how-to's, sentimental journeys, developer-ese, and more - it's all here. The idea is that some of this will be useful. There will also be superfluous and anomalous feature implementations. Browse at your own risk.
