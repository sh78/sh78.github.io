Title: When An `alias` Should Actually Be An `abbr`

The short answer is: **always**.

I really appreciate how `tmuxinator` handles completion and aliasing from a fish
shell. You type `mux`, and when you hit space it expands into `tmuxintor`. From
there you can hit tab to see the options at each step of the way.

I like it so much that I poked around in [their
completion](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator/blob/master/completion/tmuxinator.fish)
script hoping to crib some gnarly methods and do the same thing with tmux
itself. Well, there are some custom methods therein, however the main feature I
want turns out to be [built in to fish
already](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html). It's called `abbr`. 

## Why `!` alias?

- [Increased performance](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/828).
- This becomes
noticeable after a couple hundred or so in my testing.
- Clean history. Using `abbr` means other developers can understand your
terminal history. So posting an issue to GitHub doesn't require manual
substitution of your aliases, and another developer won't have trouble
deciphering history on a remote that you worked on with your dotfiles in place.
- Easy to use a shortcut that's close to what you want and edit it.
- If your shortcut conflicts with another executable that you want to run, you
can use the arrow keys to edit the expanded text, before fixing
it in your dotfiles.

[Here's a four month long GitHub issue about how `abbr` came to
be.](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/731).


## A Logical Separation of concerns

With the addition of `abbr`, we now have three distinct types of functions to
choose from while programming our programming shortcutsâ€“what? Why, yes, I do like
programming - where did you hear this?

### The three types 

1. `alias`: Make a `something` functionally equivalent to `something else`. This
   holds true if you press return, chain things together, pipe, redirect, and
   such. In recent versions of fish, context aware tab completion will work here
   too.
2. `abbr`: Type `something` and have it expanded into `something else` after
   pressing space or semicolon (but not return). The new hotness.
3. `function`: Make `something` functionally equivalent to one or more `something
   else`s, and optionally permute data that are being worked on with (`argv`).

Strictly speaking, `alias` is itself just an alias for a `function` that blindly
accepts `argv` and tacks them to the end of its `something else`. But this
pattern is so prolific that it got its own name, so we will consider it unique
for today.

### Choosing the right one

Here is how I picture the use cases:

1. `alias` **will not be used**.
2. `abbr` will be employed as the new `alias`; it will shorten phrases where we
   don't need to do anything special with `argv`.
3. `function` is for everything else; for when an `abbr` permutes `argv`
   and/or is complex/abstract enough to warrant a `--description`.

#### performance notes

Fish has a mechanism in place for
[lazily autoloading](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_autoload)
custom function definitions. This can have a noticeable performance impact over
just defining them in your config.fish or init.fish or wherever. So it's a good
idea to keep each function in its own, self-title file in
`~/.config/fish/functions/` like so:

```shell
# in ~/.config/fish/functions/ll.fish
function ll
    ls -lh $argv
end
```

In case I'm missing something and there is still a use case for `alias`,
here's a fun fact. [I heard on the
net](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/828#issuecomment-18584856)
(yes, a pun) that using the fish-style `alias` syntax is more performant than
using the `=` assignment operator due to an extra `sed` call; this was, however,
back in 2013. I didn't notice much of a difference here, but it's an easy change
and using a default syntax is always preferred in my book. (Someday maybe: make
or find a fish->bash transpiler.) 

```shell
alias l='ls'
# should be:
alias l 'ls'
```

### Practical Examples

Time for the straight dope. First up - simple and obvious choice: `git`. 

```shell
abbr --add g 'git'
```

Type `g<space>` and witness the magic. I mean dope,

Now, what if you want to replace a program with another program. I recently
switched to [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), but for some reason it felt wrong not to type `vim`. An
alias will do well here:

```shell
abbr --add vim 'nvim'
```

Note that **abbr-ception will not work**:

```shell
abbr --add v 'vim' # this will still be regular `vim`
```

What about setting default flags for programs that don't allow such
configuration? Let's say we want to default to the long-form `ls`, with
classification indicators, but hide user and group info:

```shell
abbr ls 'ls -Fog'
```

The astute observer will note that I forgot to add the `--add` here. Well, turns
out [we don't need
it](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/2443ea92c3c31c26ec1b6c3681a3e3a643250705/share/functions/abbr.fish#L14).

And now, on to something more useful. Yes, it's function time.

Normally naming things is the second most difficult part of computer science
(next to cache invalidation), but this was rather easy to name:

```shell
function take
  mkdir -p $argv; 
  cd $argv
end
```

`take` is an amalgamation of `touch` and `mk` (make). It creates a directory and
changes into it. As an added bonus it leverages the `-p` flag, which forces the
computer to create the entire path you pass it if it doesn't exist.

The use case for functions basically starts here. There are multiple
non-sequential calls to `argv` from multiple commands. 

Here is a more worthy example:

```shell
function wait --description "Run a command after some time: wait <minutes> <command args>"
  set minutes $argv[1]
  set time_in_seconds (math "$minutes*60")
  sleep $time_in_seconds; and eval "$argv[2..-1]"
end
```

## Attempted DRYness, two counts

So I at this point, I now have a 261 line file full of `abbr --add 'what have
you'`. My DRY senses be tinglin'. Isn't there a way to neither type, nor look
at, a million `abbr`s? Let's find out.

Well, we can make a [temporary helper](https://github.com/sh78/dotfiles/blob/b06b1ca2c665b3badc0584d8a021a2e6cdf83394/.config/omf/aliases.load#L1) function to shorten the abbr --add syntax.

```shell
function a
  abbr --add $argv
end

# do abbrs...
a alias='echo "nope"'

# unset the function
# unset helper function
functions -e a
```

That's still repetition though, and it's confusing for anyone else. What
about a for loop? Fish doesn't have hashes/dictionaries that I'm aware of, so I
tried reading in lines of a file and passing each one to an `abbr` call:

```shell
while read -la line
  echo "$line"
  abbr "$line"
end < $HOME/.config/omf/aliases.load
```

This way, we can maintain an abbreviations file that purely has:

```shell
name 'command here'
another 'another command here'
```

Well, after 10 minutes of fish complaining "`abbr: abbreviation cannot have
spaces in the key`" despite my best efforts to escape and slice/join the string,
I decided to cut my losses and stick with the default. 

Someday I'll learn to leave well enough alone. That will be a really boring day.
The next day, I'll start bothering well enough again.

## What have we learned?

1. Use `abbr` instead of `alias`. 
2. Use `function` even more.
3. Fish really is friendly. Unless you want to program a dictionary.
4. Don't stay awake until 1am attempting to bypass built-in functionality of you
   shell, unless someone is paying you.
